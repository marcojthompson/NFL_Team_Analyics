# NFL_Team_Analyics
 Jupyter Notebooks that scrape data from prominent NFL-based websites, with the goal of creating the ability to better visualize how teams are spending their salary cap. 

 Currently the main objective is to create a table containing every nfl player who has a salary cap being counted by their team(exludes players not on the active roster, such as practice squad, Injured Reserve, or PUP list).
